  title: AI Reviewing Equilibrium
  domain: artificial_intelligence
  hypothesis: 'Different AI models may provide distinct opinions and suggestions when
    reviewing papers, and the dynamics of paper improvement may change when multiple
    models are involved in the review process.

    '
  background:
    description: AI reviewing may help us improve the quality of papers. But do different
      AI models actually provide different opinions and suggestions? How do the dynamics
      change when multiple models aim to improve a paper?
