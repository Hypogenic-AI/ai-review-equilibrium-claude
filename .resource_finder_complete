=== RESEARCH TOPIC ===
AI Reviewing Equilibrium

=== HYPOTHESIS ===
Different AI models may provide distinct opinions and suggestions when reviewing papers, and the dynamics of paper improvement may change when multiple models are involved in the review process.

=== KEY FINDINGS FROM LITERATURE ===
1. Different LLMs exhibit distinct biases when reviewing papers:
   - General LLMs (GPT-4, Claude) tend to be overly positive
   - Specialized models (OpenReviewer) are more critical
   - Each model family has systematic tendencies

2. Multi-agent review systems produce different dynamics:
   - Agent interactions affect final outcomes (37.1% decision variation)
   - Biased agents can influence unbiased ones (echo chamber effects)
   - Multiple specialized agents improve review quality (2.2x improvement)

3. Research gap identified:
   - Current work uses same model (GPT-4) for all agents
   - No systematic study of cross-model equilibrium dynamics
   - This research can fill the gap by studying GPT-4 + Claude + Gemini interactions

=== RECOMMENDED APPROACH ===
1. Use PeerRead (ICLR 2017) as primary dataset with human review ground truth
2. Extend AgentReview framework to support multiple model providers
3. Compare single-model vs multi-model review dynamics
4. Study consensus formation and paper improvement trajectories
