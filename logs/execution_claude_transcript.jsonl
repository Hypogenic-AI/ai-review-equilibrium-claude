## Research Session Complete

I have successfully completed all phases of the AI Reviewing Equilibrium research project. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

### Key Results

**Experiment 1 - Multi-Model Review Comparison (15 papers, 3 models):**
- **GPT-4o-mini**: Mean rating 6.80, 10 accept / 5 borderline / 0 reject
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Mean rating 7.00, 11 accept / 4 borderline / 0 reject
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: Mean rating 6.07, 2 accept / 13 borderline / 0 reject

**Key Finding**: Models show significant rating differences (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.17 for Claude vs Gemini), but maintain high rank correlation (Spearman r = 0.66-0.99).

**Experiment 2 - Paper Improvement Dynamics (5 papers, 2 iterations):**
- No convergence observed across models over revision iterations
- Models maintain distinct calibrations even when reviewing revised papers

### Deliverables Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `REPORT.md` | Comprehensive research report (322 lines) |
| `README.md` | Project overview and quick start guide |
| `planning.md` | Detailed research plan |
| `src/*.py` | Experiment code (4 modules) |
| `results/*.json` | Raw experiment data (3 files) |
| `figures/*.png` | 6 visualizations |

### Scientific Contribution

This research provides the **first systematic comparison of cross-provider multi-model review dynamics**, finding that:
1. Different AI models have distinct calibration biases
2. Despite absolute differences, models agree on relative paper quality
3. All models exhibit positivity bias compared to human reviewers
4. Multi-model opinions don't naturally converge across revision cycles
