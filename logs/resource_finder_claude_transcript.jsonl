All tasks are complete. Here's a summary of the resource finding phase:

---

## Resource Finding Phase Complete ✓

### Research Topic: AI Reviewing Equilibrium

**Hypothesis**: Different AI models may provide distinct opinions and suggestions when reviewing papers, and the dynamics of paper improvement may change when multiple models are involved in the review process.

---

### Resources Collected

| Category | Count | Size |
|----------|-------|------|
| **Papers** | 9 PDFs | 29 MB |
| **Datasets** | 2 (PeerRead, SEA) | 2.6 GB |
| **Repositories** | 3 (AgentReview, MARG, OpenReviewData) | 100 MB |

---

### Key Papers Downloaded
1. **AgentReview** (EMNLP 2024) - LLM peer review simulation, 37.1% decision variation from biases
2. **MARG** - Multi-agent review generation, 2.2x improvement in helpful comments
3. **OpenReviewer** - Specialized review model showing general LLMs are overly positive
4. **ReviewAgents** - Multi-role chain-of-thought review framework
5. Two comprehensive LLM-as-Judge surveys
6. **PeerRead** - Foundational peer review dataset paper

---

### Primary Dataset: PeerRead
- 14,784 papers, 10,770 reviews
- ICLR 2017: 427 papers with detailed reviews
- Includes aspect scores (originality, clarity) and accept/reject decisions
- Ideal for comparing LLM reviews against human expert reviews

---

### Key Finding from Literature
**Research gap identified**: Current multi-agent review systems use the same model (GPT-4) for all agents. No systematic study exists of equilibrium dynamics when different model providers (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) participate together in the review process.

---

### Recommended Experimental Approach
1. Use PeerRead as ground truth with human reviews
2. Extend AgentReview framework for multiple model providers
3. Compare single-model vs multi-model review dynamics
4. Study consensus formation and paper improvement trajectories
