      "abstract": "Transferring knowledge from prior source tasks in solving a new target task can be useful in several learning applications. The application of transfer poses two serious challenges which have not been adequately addressed. First, the agent should be able to avoid negative transfer, which happens when the transfer hampers or slows down the learning instead of helping it. Second, the agent should be able to selectively transfer, which is the ability to select and transfer from different and multip...",

          "This paper studies the problem of transferring solutions of existing tasks to tackle a novel task under the framework of reinforcement learning and identifies two important issues of avoiding negative transfer and being selective transfer. The proposed approach is based on a convex combination of existing solutions and the being-learned solution to the novel task. The non-negative weight of each solution implies that the solution of negative effect is ignored and more weights are allocated to more relevant solution in each state. This paper derives this so-called \"A2T\" learning algorithm for policy transfer and value transfer for REINFORCE and ACTOR-CRITIC algorithms and experiments with synthetic Chain World and Puddle World simulation and Atari 2600 game Pong. \n+This paper presents a novel approach for transfer reinforcement learning.\n+The experiments are cleverly designed to demonstrate the ability of the proposed method.\n-An important aspect of transfer learning is that the algorithm can automatically figure out if the existing solutions to known tasks are sufficient to solve the novel task so that it can save the time and energy of learning-from-scratch. This issue is not studied in this paper as most of experiments have a learning-from-scratch solution as base network. It will be interesting to see how well the algorithm performs without base network. In addition, from Figure 3, 5 and 6, the proposed algorithm seems to accelerate the learning speed, but the overall network seems not better than the solo base network. It will be more convincing to show some example that existing solutions are complementary to the base network.\n-If ignoring the base network, the proposed network can be considered as ensemble reinforcement learning that take advantages of learned agents with different expertise to solve the novel task.

          "The paper tackles important problems in multi-task reinforcement learning: avoid negative transfer and allow finer selective transfer. The method is based on soft attention mechanism, very general, and demonstrated to be applicable in both policy gradient and value iteration methods. The introduction of base network allows learning new policy if the prior policies aren't directly applicable. State-dependent sub policy selection allows finer control and can be thought of assigning state space to different sub policies/experts. The tasks are relatively simplistic but sufficient to demonstrate the benefits. One limitation is that the method is simple and the results/claims are mostly empirical.

          "[UPDATE]\nAfter going through the response from the author and the revision, I increased my review score for two reasons.\n1. I thank the reviewers for further investigating the difference between yours and the other work (Scheduled sampling, Unsupervised learning using LSTM) and providing some insights about it.\nThis paper at least shows empirically that 100%-Pred scheme is better for high-dimensional video and for long-term predictions.\nIt would be good if the authors briefly discuss this in the final revision (either in the appendix or in the main text).\n\n2. The revised paper contains more comprehensive results than before.\nThe presented result and discussion in this paper will be quite useful to the research community as high-dimensional video prediction involves large-scale experiments that are computationally expensive.\n\n- Summary\nThis paper presents a new RNN architecture for action-conditional future prediction. The proposed architecture combines actions into the recurrent connection of the LSTM core, which performs better than the previous state-of-the-art architecture [Oh et al.]. The paper also explores and compares different architectures such as frame-dependent/independent mode and observation/prediction-dependent architectures. The experimental result shows that the proposed architecture with fully prediction-dependent training scheme achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several complex visual domains. It is also shown that the proposed prediction architecture can be used to improve exploration in a 3D environment.\n\n- Novelty\nThe novelty of the proposed architecture is not strong. The difference between [Oh et al.] and this work is that actions are combined into the LSTM in this paper, while actions are combined after LSTM in [Oh et al.]. The jumpy prediction was already introduced by [Srivastava et al.] in the deep learning area. \n\n- Experiment\nThe experiments are well-designed and thorough. Specifically, the paper evaluates different training schemes and compares different architectures using several rich domains (Atari, 3D worlds). Besides, the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results on many domains and presents an application for model-based exploration.\n\n- Clarity\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n\n- Overall \nAlthough the proposed architecture is not much novel, it achieves promising results on Atari games and 3D environments. In addition, the systematic evaluation of different architectures presented in the paper would be useful to the community.\n\n[Reference]\nNitish Srivastava, Elman Mansimov, Ruslan Salakhutdinov. Unsupervised Learning with LSTMs. ICML 2016.",
          "The paper presents an action-conditional recurrent network that can predict frames in video games hundreds of steps in the future. The paper claims three main contributions: \n1. modification to model architecture (used in Oh et al.) by using action at time t-1 to directly predict hidden state at t\n2. exploring the idea of jumpy predictions (predictions multiple frames in future without using intermediate frames)\n3. exploring different training schemes (trade-off between observation and prediction frames for training LSTM)\n\n1. modification to model architecture\n+ The motivation seems good that in past work (Oh et al.) the action at t-1 influences x_t, but not the state h_t of the LSTM. This could be fixed by making the LSTM state h_t dependent on a_{t-1}\n- However, this is of minor technical novelty. Also, as pointed in reviewer questions, a similar effect could be achieved by adding a_t-1 as an input to the LSTM at time t. This could be done without modifying the LSTM architecture as stated in the paper. While the authors claim that combining a_t-1 with h_t-1 and s_t-1 performs worse than the current method which combines a_t-1 only with h_t-1, I would have liked to see the empirical difference in combining a_t-1 only with s_t-1 or only with h_t-1. Also, a stronger motivation is required to support the current formulation.\n- Further, the benefits of this change in architecture is not well analyzed in experiments. Fig. 5(a) provides the difference between Oh et al. (with traditional LSTM) and current method. However, the performance difference is composed of 2 components (difference in training scheme and architecture). This contribution of the architecture to the performance is not clear from this experiment. The authors did claim in the pre-review phase that Fig. 12 (a) shows the difference in performance only due to architecture for \"Seaquest\". However, from this plot it appears that the gain at 100-steps (~15)  is only a small fraction of the overall gain in Fig. 5 (a) (~90). It is difficult to judge the significance of the architecture modification from this result for one game.\n\n2. Exploring the idea of jumpy predictions:\n+ As stated by the authors, omitting the intermediate frames while predicting future frames could significantly sppedup simulations.\n+ The results in Fig. 5(b) present some interesting observations that omitting intermediate frames does not lead to significant error-increase for at least a few games.\n- However, it is again not clear whether the modification in the current model leads to this effect or it could be achieved by previous models like Oh et al.\n- While, the observations themselves are interesting, it would have been better to provide a more detailed analysis for more games. Also, the novelty in dropping intermediate frames for speedup is marginal.\n\n3. Exploring different training schemes\n+ This is perhaps the most interesting observation presented in the paper. The authors present the difference in performance for different training schemes in Fig. 2(a). The training schemes are varied based on the fraction of training phase which only uses observation frames and the fraction that uses only prediction frames.\n+ The results show that this change in training can significantly affect prediction results and is the biggest contributor to performance improvement compared to Oh et al.\n- While this observation is interesting, this effect has been previously explored in detail in other works like schedule sampling (Bengio et al.) and to some extent in Oh et al.\n\nClarity of presentation:\n- The exact experimental setup is not clearly stated for some of the results. For instance, the paper does not say that Fig. 2(a) uses the same architecture as Oh et al. However, this is stated in the response to reviewer questions.\n- Fig. 4 is difficult to interpret. The qualitative difference between Oh et al. and current method could be highlighted explicitly. \n- Minor: The qualitative analysis section requires the reader to navigate to various video-links in order to understand the section.

          "[UPDATE]\nAfter going through the response from the author and the revision, I increased my review score for two reasons.\n1. I thank the reviewers for further investigating the difference between yours and the other work (Scheduled sampling, Unsupervised learning using LSTM) and providing some insights about it.\nThis paper at least shows empirically that 100%-Pred scheme is better for high-dimensional video and for long-term predictions.\nIt would be good if the authors briefly discuss this in the final revision (either in the appendix or in the main text).\n\n2. The revised paper contains more comprehensive results than before.\nThe presented result and discussion in this paper will be quite useful to the research community as high-dimensional video prediction involves large-scale experiments that are computationally expensive.\n\n- Summary\nThis paper presents a new RNN architecture for action-conditional future prediction. The proposed architecture combines actions into the recurrent connection of the LSTM core, which performs better than the previous state-of-the-art architecture [Oh et al.]. The paper also explores and compares different architectures such as frame-dependent/independent mode and observation/prediction-dependent architectures. The experimental result shows that the proposed architecture with fully prediction-dependent training scheme achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several complex visual domains. It is also shown that the proposed prediction architecture can be used to improve exploration in a 3D environment.\n\n- Novelty\nThe novelty of the proposed architecture is not strong. The difference between [Oh et al.] and this work is that actions are combined into the LSTM in this paper, while actions are combined after LSTM in [Oh et al.]. The jumpy prediction was already introduced by [Srivastava et al.] in the deep learning area. \n\n- Experiment\nThe experiments are well-designed and thorough. Specifically, the paper evaluates different training schemes and compares different architectures using several rich domains (Atari, 3D worlds). Besides, the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results on many domains and presents an application for model-based exploration.\n\n- Clarity\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n\n- Overall \nAlthough the proposed architecture is not much novel, it achieves promising results on Atari games and 3D environments. In addition, the systematic evaluation of different architectures presented in the paper would be useful to the community.\n\n[Reference]\nNitish Srivastava, Elman Mansimov, Ruslan Salakhutdinov.

          "The paper presents an action-conditional recurrent network that can predict frames in video games hundreds of steps in the future. The paper claims three main contributions: \n1. modification to model architecture (used in Oh et al.) by using action at time t-1 to directly predict hidden state at t\n2. exploring the idea of jumpy predictions (predictions multiple frames in future without using intermediate frames)\n3. exploring different training schemes (trade-off between observation and prediction frames for training LSTM)\n\n1. modification to model architecture\n+ The motivation seems good that in past work (Oh et al.) the action at t-1 influences x_t, but not the state h_t of the LSTM. This could be fixed by making the LSTM state h_t dependent on a_{t-1}\n- However, this is of minor technical novelty. Also, as pointed in reviewer questions, a similar effect could be achieved by adding a_t-1 as an input to the LSTM at time t. This could be done without modifying the LSTM architecture as stated in the paper. While the authors claim that combining a_t-1 with h_t-1 and s_t-1 performs worse than the current method which combines a_t-1 only with h_t-1, I would have liked to see the empirical difference in combining a_t-1 only with s_t-1 or only with h_t-1. Also, a stronger motivation is required to support the current formulation.\n- Further, the benefits of this change in architecture is not well analyzed in experiments. Fig. 5(a) provides the difference between Oh et al. (with traditional LSTM) and current method. However, the performance difference is composed of 2 components (difference in training scheme and architecture). This contribution of the architecture to the performance is not clear from this experiment. The authors did claim in the pre-review phase that Fig. 12 (a) shows the difference in performance only due to architecture for \"Seaquest\". However, from this plot it appears that the gain at 100-steps (~15)  is only a small fraction of the overall gain in Fig. 5 (a) (~90). It is difficult to judge the significance of the architecture modification from this result for one game.\n\n2. Exploring the idea of jumpy predictions:\n+ As stated by the authors, omitting the intermediate frames while predicting future frames could significantly sppedup simulations.\n+ The results in Fig. 5(b) present some interesting observations that omitting intermediate frames does not lead to significant error-increase for at least a few games.\n- However, it is again not clear whether the modification in the current model leads to this effect or it could be achieved by previous models like Oh et al.\n- While, the observations themselves are interesting, it would have been better to provide a more detailed analysis for more games. Also, the novelty in dropping intermediate frames for speedup is marginal.\n\n3. Exploring different training schemes\n+ This is perhaps the most interesting observation presented in the paper. The authors present the difference in performance for different training schemes in Fig. 2(a). The training schemes are varied based on the fraction of training phase which only uses observation frames and the fraction that uses only prediction frames.\n+ The results show that this change in training can significantly affect prediction results and is the biggest contributor to performance improvement compared to Oh et al.\n- While this observation is interesting, this effect has been previously explored in detail in other works like schedule sampling (Bengio et al.) and to some extent in Oh et al.\n\nClarity of presentation:\n- The exact experimental setup is not clearly stated for some of the results. For instance, the paper does not say that Fig. 2(a) uses the same architecture as Oh et al. However, this is stated in the response to reviewer questions.\n- Fig. 4 is difficult to interpret. The qualitative difference between Oh et al. and current method could be highlighted explicitly. \n- Minor: The qualitative analysis section requires the reader to navigate to various video-links in order to understand the section. This leads to a discontinuity in reading and is particularly difficult while reading a printed-copy.\n\nOverall, the paper presents some interesting experimental observations. However, the technical novelty and contribution of the proposed architecture and training scheme is not clear.",

          "Summary\n===\nThis paper proposes the Neural Physics Engine (NPE), a network architecture\nwhich simulates object interactions. While NPE decides to explicitly represent\nobjects (rather than video frames), it incorporates knowledge of physics\nalmost exclusively through training data. It is tested in a toy domain with\nbouncing 2d balls.\n\nThe proposed architecture processes each object in a scene one at a time.\nPairs of objects are embedded in a common space where the effect of the\nobjects on each other can be represented. These embeddings are summed\nand combined with the focus object's state to predict the focus object's\nchange in velocity. Alternative baselines are presented which either\nforego the pairwise embedding for a single object embedding or\nencode a focus object's neighbors in a sequence of LSTM states.\n\nNPE outperforms the baselines dramatically, showing the importance of\narchitecture choices in learning to do this object based simulation.\nThe model is tested in multiple ways. Ability to predict object trajectory\nover long time spans is measured. Generalization to different numbers of objects\nis measured. Generalization to slightly altered environments (difference\nshaped walls) is measured. Finally, the NPE is also trained to predict\nobject mass using only interactions with other objects, where it also\noutperforms baselines.\n\n\nComments\n===\n\n* I have one more clarifying question. Are the inputs to the blue box in\nfigure 3 (b)/(c) the concatenation of the summed embeddings and state vector\nof object 3? Or is the input to the blue module some other combination of the\ntwo vectors?\n\n\n* Section 2.1 begins with \"First, because physics does not\nchange across inertial frames, it suffices to separately predict the future state of each object conditioned\non the past states of itself and the other objects in its neighborhood, similar to Fragkiadaki\net al.

          "- summary\n\nThe paper proposes a differntiable Neural Physics Engine (NPE). The NPE consists of an encoder and a decoder function. The NPE takes as input the state of pairs of objects (within a neighbourhood of a focus object) at two previous time-steps in a scene. The encoder function summarizes the interaction of each pair of objects. The decoder then outputs the change in velocity of the focus object at the next time step. The NPE is evaluated on various environments containing bouncing balls.\n\n- novelty\n\nThe differentiable NPE is a novel concept. However, concurrently Battaglia et al. (NIPS 2016) proposes a very similar model. Just as this work, Battaglia et al. (NIPS 2016) consider a model which consists of a encoder function (relation-centric) which encodes the interaction among a focus object and other objects in the scene and a decoder (relation-centric) function which considers the cumulative (encoded) effect of object interactions on the focus object and predicts effect of the interactions.  Aspects like only considering objects interactions within a neighbourhood (versus the complete object interaction graph in Battaglia et al.) based on euclideian distance  are novel to this work. However, the advantages (if any) of NPE versus the model of Battaglia et al. are not clear.

          "Summary\n===\nThis paper proposes the Neural Physics Engine (NPE), a network architecture\nwhich simulates object interactions. While NPE decides to explicitly represent\nobjects (rather than video frames), it incorporates knowledge of physics\nalmost exclusively through training data. It is tested in a toy domain with\nbouncing 2d balls.\n\nThe proposed architecture processes each object in a scene one at a time.\nPairs of objects are embedded in a common space where the effect of the\nobjects on each other can be represented. These embeddings are summed\nand combined with the focus object's state to predict the focus object's\nchange in velocity. Alternative baselines are presented which either\nforego the pairwise embedding for a single object embedding or\nencode a focus object's neighbors in a sequence of LSTM states.\n\nNPE outperforms the baselines dramatically, showing the importance of\narchitecture choices in learning to do this object based simulation.\nThe model is tested in multiple ways. Ability to predict object trajectory\nover long time spans is measured. Generalization to different numbers of objects\nis measured. Generalization to slightly altered environments (difference\nshaped walls) is measured. Finally, the NPE is also trained to predict\nobject mass using only interactions with other objects, where it also\noutperforms baselines.\n\n\nComments\n===\n\n* I have one more clarifying question. Are the inputs to the blue box in\nfigure 3 (b)/(c) the concatenation of the summed embeddings and state vector\nof object 3? Or is the input to the blue module some other combination of the\ntwo vectors?\n\n\n* Section 2.1 begins with \"First, because physics does not\nchange across inertial frames, it suffices to separately predict the future state of each object conditioned\non the past states of itself and the other objects in its neighborhood, similar to Fragkiadaki\net al.

At this point, the paper is still not suitable for publication, so I'm leaving the rating untouched.\n\nThis paper proposes a transfer learning method addressing optimization complexity and class imbalance.\n\nMy main concerns are the following:\n\n1. The paper is quite hard to read due to typos, unusual phrasing and loose use of terminology like \u201cdistributed\u201d, \u201ctransfer learning\u201d (meaning \u201cfine-tuning\u201d), \u201csoftmax\u201d (meaning \u201cfully-connected\u201d), \u201cdeep learning\u201d (meaning \u201cbase neural network\u201d),  etc. I\u2019m still not sure I got all the details of the actual algorithm right.\n\n2. The captions to the figures and tables are not very informative \u2013 one has to jump back and forth through the paper to understand what the numbers/images mean.\n\n3. From what I understand, the authors use \u201cconventional transfer learning\u201d to refer to fine-tuning of the fully-connected layers only (I\u2019m judging by Figure 1). In this case, it\u2019s essential to compare the proposed method with regimes when some of the convolutional layers are also updated. This comparison is not present in the paper.\n\nComments on the pre-review questions:\n\n1. Question 1: If the paper only considers the case |C|==|L|, it would be better to reduce the notation clutter.\n\n2. Question 2: It is still not clear what the authors mean by distributed transfer learning. Figure 1 is supposed to highlight the difference from the conventional approach (fine-tuning of the fully-connected layers; by the way, I don\u2019t think, Softmax is a conventional term for fully-connected layers). From the diagram, it follows that the base CNN has the same number of convolutional filters at every layer and, in order to obtain a distributed ensemble, we need to connect (for some reason) filters with the same indices. This does not make a lot of sense to me but I\u2019m probably misinterpreting the figure. Could the authors revise the diagram to make it clearer?\n\nOverall, I think the paper needs significant refinement in order improve the clarity of presentation and thus cannot be accepted as it is now.",

          "This work proposes to use basic probability assignment to improve deep transfer learning. A particular re-weighting scheme inspired by Dempster-Shaffer and exploiting the confusion matrix of the source task is introduced. The authors also suggest learning the convolutional filters separately to break non-convexity. \n\nThe main problem with this paper is the writing. There are many typos, and the presentation is not clear. For example, the way the training set for weak classifiers are constructed remains unclear to me despite the author's previous answer. I do not buy the explanation about the use of both training and validation sets to compute BPA. Also, I am not convinced non-convexity is a problem here and the author does not provide an ablation study to validate the necessity of separately learning the filters. One last question is CIFAR has three channels and MNIST only one: How it this handled when pairing the datasets in the second set of experiments?\n\nOverall, I believe the proposed idea of reweighing is interesting, but the work can be globally improved/clarified. \n\nI suggest a reject. ",
          "Update: I thank the author for his comments! At this point, the paper is still not suitable for publication, so I'm leaving the rating untouched.\n\nThis paper proposes a transfer learning method addressing optimization complexity and class imbalance.\n\nMy main concerns are the following:\n\n1. The paper is quite hard to read due to typos, unusual phrasing and loose use of terminology like \u201cdistributed\u201d, \u201ctransfer learning\u201d (meaning \u201cfine-tuning\u201d), \u201csoftmax\u201d (meaning \u201cfully-connected\u201d), \u201cdeep learning\u201d (meaning \u201cbase neural network\u201d),  etc. I\u2019m still not sure I got all the details of the actual algorithm right.\n\n2. The captions to the figures and tables are not very informative \u2013 one has to jump back and forth through the paper to understand what the numbers/images mean.\n\n3. From what I understand, the authors use \u201cconventional transfer learning\u201d to refer to fine-tuning of the fully-connected layers only (I\u2019m judging by Figure 1). In this case, it\u2019s essential to compare the proposed method with regimes when some of the convolutional layers are also updated. This comparison is not present in the paper.\n\nComments on the pre-review questions:\n\n1. Question 1: If the paper only considers the case |C|==|L|, it would be better to reduce the notation clutter.\n\n2. Question 2: It is still not clear what the authors mean by distributed transfer learning. Figure 1 is supposed to highlight the difference from the conventional approach (fine-tuning of the fully-connected layers; by the way, I don\u2019t think, Softmax is a conventional term for fully-connected layers). From the diagram, it follows that the base CNN has the same number of convolutional filters at every layer and, in order to obtain a distributed ensemble, we need to connect (for some reason) filters with the same indices. This does not make a lot of sense to me but I\u2019m probably misinterpreting the figure. Could the authors revise the diagram to make it clearer?\n\nOverall, I think the paper needs significant refinement in order improve the clarity of presentation and thus cannot be accepted as it is now.",

          "This paper makes three main methodological contributions:\n - definition of Neural Feature (NF) as the pixel average of the top N images that highly activation a neuron\n - ranking of neurons based on color selectivity\n - ranking of neurons based on class selectivity\n\nThe main weaknesses of the paper are that none of the methodological contributions are very significant, and no singularly significant result arises from the application of the methods.\n\nHowever, the main strengths of the paper are its assortment of moderately-sized interesting conclusions about the basic behavior of neural nets. For example, a few are:\n - \u201cIndexing on class selectivity neurons we found highly class selective neurons like digital-clock at conv2, cardoon at conv3 and ladybug at conv5, much before the fully connected layers.\u201d As far as I know, this had not been previously reported.\n - Color selective neurons are found even in higher layers. (25% color selectivity in conv5)\n - \u201cour main color axis emerge (black-white, blue-yellow, orange-cyan and cyan- magenta). Curiously, these two observations correlate with evidences in the human visual system (Shapley & Hawken (2011)).\u201d Great observation!\n\nOverall, I\u2019d recommend the paper be accepted, because although it\u2019s difficult to predict at this time, there\u2019s a fair chance that one of the \u201csmaller conclusions\u201d would turn out to be important in hindsight a few years hence.\n\n\nOther small comments:\n - The cite for \u201cLearning to generate chairs\u2026\u201d is wrong (first two authors combined resulting in a confusing cite)\n\n - What exactly is the Color Selectivity Index computing? The Opponent Color Space isn\u2019t well defined and it wasn\u2019t previously familiar to me. Intuitively it seems to be selecting for units that respond to a constant color, but the highest color selectivity NF in Fig 5 i for a unit with two colors, not one. Finally, the very last unit (lowest color selectivity) is almost the same edge pattern, but with white -> black instead of blue -> orange. Why are these considered to be so drastically different? This should probably be more clearly described.\n\n - For the sake of argument, imagine a mushroom sensitive neuron in conv5 that fires highly for mushrooms of *any* color but not for anything else. If the dataset contains only red-capped mushrooms, would the color selectivity index for this neuron be high or low? If it is high, it\u2019s somewhat misleading because the unit itself actually isn\u2019t color selective; the dataset just happens only to have red mushrooms in it. (It\u2019s a subtle point but worth considering and probably discussing in the paper)\n",
          "The authors analyze trained neural networks by quantifying the selectivity of individual neurons in the network for a variety of specific features, including color and category.   \n\nPros:\n   * The paper is clearly written and has good figures. \n   * I think they executed their specific stated goal reasonably well technically.   E.g. the various indexes they use seem well-chosen for their purposes. \n\nCons:\n   * I must admit that I am biased against the whole enterprise of this paper.   I do not think it is well-motivated or provides any useful insight whatever.   What I view their having done is produced, and then summarized anecdotally, a catalog of piecemeal facts about a neural network without any larger reason to think these particular facts are important.  In a way, I feel like this paper suffers from the same problem that plagues a typical line of research in neurophysiology, in which a catalog of selectivity distributions of various neurons for various properties is produced -- full stop.  As if that were in and of itself important or useful information.   I do not feel that either the original neural version of that project, or this current model-based virtual electrophysiology, is that useful.   Why should we care about the distribution of color selectivities?   Why does knowing distribution as such constitute \"understanding\"?    To my mind it doesn't, at least not directly.   \n\nHere's what they could have done to make a more useful investigation:\n  \n     (a) From a neuroscience point of view, they could have compared the properties that they measure in models to the same properties as measured in neurons the real brain.   If they could show that some models are better matches on these properties to the actual neural data than others, that would be a really interesting result.   That is is to say, the two isolated catalogs of selectivities (from model neurons and real neurons)  alone seem pretty pointless.  But if the correspondence between the two catalogs was made -- both in terms of where the model neurons and the real neurons were similar, and (especially importantly) where they were different --- that would be the beginning of nontrivial understanding.   Such results would also complement a growing body of literature that attempts to link CNNs to visual brain areas.  Finding good neural data is challenging, but whatever the result, the comparison would be interesting. \n\nand/or \n\n    (b) From an artificial intelligence point of view, they could have shown that their metrics are *prescriptive* constraints.   That is, suppose they had shown that the specific color and class selectivity indices that they compute, when imposed as a loss-function criterion on an untrained neural network, cause the network to develop useful filters and achieve significantly above-chance performance on the original task the networks were trained on.     This would be a really great result, because it would not only give us a priori reason to care about the specific property metrics they chose, but it would also help contribute to efforts to find unsupervised (or semi-supervised) learning procedures, since the metrics they compute can be estimated from comparatively small numbers of stimuli and/or high-level semantic labels.    To put this in perspective, imagine that they had actually tested the above hypothesis and found it to be false:  that is, that their metrics, when used as loss function constraints, do not improve performance noticeably above chance performance.  What would we then make of this whole investigation?  It would then be reasonable to think that the measured properties were essentially epiphenomenal and didn't contribute at all to the power of neural networks in solving perceptual tasks.  (The same could be said about neurophysiology experiments doing the same thing.)  \n     [--> NB: I've actually tried things just like this myself over the years, and have found exactly this disappointing result.  Specifically,  I've found a number of high-level generic statistical property of DNNs that seem like they might potentially \"interesting\", e.g. because they apparently correlate with complexity or appear to illustrate difference between low, intermediate and high layers of DNNs.  Every single one of these, when imposed as optimization constraints, has basically lead nowhere on the challenging tasks (like ImageNet) that cause the DNNs to be interesting in the first place.  Basically, there is to my mind no evidence at this point that highly-summarized generic statistical distributions of selectivities, like those illustrated here, place any interesting constraints on filter weights at all.   Of course, I haven't tried the specific properties the authors highlight in these papers, so maybe there's something important there.]\n\nI know that both of these asks are pretty hard, but I just don't know what else to say -- this work otherwise seems like a step backwards for what the community ought to be spending its time on. \n ",
          "This paper attempts to understand and visualize what deep nets are representing as one ascends from low levels to high levels of the network.  As has been shown previously, lower levels are more local image feature based, whereas higher levels correspond to abstract properties such as object identity.  In semantic space, we find higher level nodes to be more semantically selective, whereas low level nodes are more diffuse.\n\nThis seems like a good attempt to tease apart deep net representations.  Perhaps the most important finding is that color figures prominently into all levels of the network, and that performance on gray scale images is significantly diminished.

          "This paper makes three main methodological contributions:\n - definition of Neural Feature (NF) as the pixel average of the top N images that highly activation a neuron\n - ranking of neurons based on color selectivity\n - ranking of neurons based on class selectivity\n\nThe main weaknesses of the paper are that none of the methodological contributions are very significant, and no singularly significant result arises from the application of the methods.\n\nHowever, the main strengths of the paper are its assortment of moderately-sized interesting conclusions about the basic behavior of neural nets. For example, a few are:\n - \u201cIndexing on class selectivity neurons we found highly class selective neurons like digital-clock at conv2, cardoon at conv3 and ladybug at conv5, much before the fully connected layers.\u201d As far as I know, this had not been previously reported.\n - Color selective neurons are found even in higher layers. (25% color selectivity in conv5)\n - \u201cour main color axis emerge (black-white, blue-yellow, orange-cyan and cyan- magenta). Curiously, these two observations correlate with evidences in the human visual system (Shapley & Hawken (2011)).\u201d Great observation!\n\nOverall, I\u2019d recommend the paper be accepted, because although it\u2019s difficult to predict at this time, there\u2019s a fair chance that one of the \u201csmaller conclusions\u201d would turn out to be important in hindsight a few years hence.\n\n\nOther small comments:\n - The cite for \u201cLearning to generate chairs\u2026\u201d is wrong (first two authors combined resulting in a confusing cite)\n\n - What exactly is the Color Selectivity Index computing? The Opponent Color Space isn\u2019t well defined and it wasn\u2019t previously familiar to me. Intuitively it seems to be selecting for units that respond to a constant color, but the highest color selectivity NF in Fig 5 i for a unit with two colors, not one. Finally, the very last unit (lowest color selectivity) is almost the same edge pattern, but with white -> black instead of blue -> orange. Why are these considered to be so drastically different? This should probably be more clearly described.\n\n - For the sake of argument, imagine a mushroom sensitive neuron in conv5 that fires highly for mushrooms of *any* color but not for anything else. If the dataset contains only red-capped mushrooms, would the color selectivity index for this neuron be high or low? If it is high, it\u2019s somewhat misleading because the unit itself actually isn\u2019t color selective; the dataset just happens only to have red mushrooms in it. (It\u2019s a subtle point but worth considering and probably discussing in the paper)\n",
          "The authors analyze trained neural networks by quantifying the selectivity of individual neurons in the network for a variety of specific features, including color and category.   \n\nPros:\n   * The paper is clearly written and has good figures. \n   * I think they executed their specific stated goal reasonably well technically.   E.g. the various indexes they use seem well-chosen for their purposes. \n\nCons:\n   * I must admit that I am biased against the whole enterprise of this paper.   I do not think it is well-motivated or provides any useful insight whatever.   What I view their having done is produced, and then summarized anecdotally, a catalog of piecemeal facts about a neural network without any larger reason to think these particular facts are important.  In a way, I feel like this paper suffers from the same problem that plagues a typical line of research in neurophysiology, in which a catalog of selectivity distributions of various neurons for various properties is produced -- full stop.  As if that were in and of itself important or useful information.   I do not feel that either the original neural version of that project, or this current model-based virtual electrophysiology, is that useful.   Why should we care about the distribution of color selectivities?   Why does knowing distribution as such constitute \"understanding\"?    To my mind it doesn't, at least not directly.   \n\nHere's what they could have done to make a more useful investigation:\n  \n     (a) From a neuroscience point of view, they could have compared the properties that they measure in models to the same properties as measured in neurons the real brain.   If they could show that some models are better matches on these properties to the actual neural data than others, that would be a really interesting result.   That is is to say, the two isolated catalogs of selectivities (from model neurons and real neurons)  alone seem pretty pointless.  But if the correspondence between the two catalogs was made -- both in terms of where the model neurons and the real neurons were similar, and (especially importantly) where they were different --- that would be the beginning of nontrivial understanding.   Such results would also complement a growing body of literature that attempts to link CNNs to visual brain areas.  Finding good neural data is challenging, but whatever the result, the comparison would be interesting. \n\nand/or \n\n    (b) From an artificial intelligence point of view, they could have shown that their metrics are *prescriptive* constraints.   That is, suppose they had shown that the specific color and class selectivity indices that they compute, when imposed as a loss-function criterion on an untrained neural network, cause the network to develop useful filters and achieve significantly above-chance performance on the original task the networks were trained on.     This would be a really great result, because it would not only give us a priori reason to care about the specific property metrics they chose, but it would also help contribute to efforts to find unsupervised (or semi-supervised) learning procedures, since the metrics they compute can be estimated from comparatively small numbers of stimuli and/or high-level semantic labels.    To put this in perspective, imagine that they had actually tested the above hypothesis and found it to be false:  that is, that their metrics, when used as loss function constraints, do not improve performance noticeably above chance performance.  What would we then make of this whole investigation?  It would then be reasonable to think that the measured properties were essentially epiphenomenal and didn't contribute at all to the power of neural networks in solving perceptual tasks.  (The same could be said about neurophysiology experiments doing the same thing.)  \n     [--> NB: I've actually tried things just like this myself over the years, and have found exactly this disappointing result.  Specifically,  I've found a number of high-level generic statistical property of DNNs that seem like they might potentially \"interesting\", e.g. because they apparently correlate with complexity or appear to illustrate difference between low, intermediate and high layers of DNNs.  Every single one of these, when imposed as optimization constraints, has basically lead nowhere on the challenging tasks (like ImageNet) that cause the DNNs to be interesting in the first place.  Basically, there is to my mind no evidence at this point that highly-summarized generic statistical distributions of selectivities, like those illustrated here, place any interesting constraints on filter weights at all.   Of course, I haven't tried the specific properties the authors highlight in these papers, so maybe there's something important there.]\n\nI know that both of these asks are pretty hard, but I just don't know what else to say -- this work otherwise seems like a step backwards for what the community ought to be spending its time on. \n ",
          "This paper attempts to understand and visualize what deep nets are representing as one ascends from low levels to high levels of the network.  As has been shown previously, lower levels are more local image feature based, whereas higher levels correspond to abstract properties such as object identity.  In semantic space, we find higher level nodes to be more semantically selective, whereas low level nodes are more diffuse.\n\nThis seems like a good attempt to tease apart deep net representations.  Perhaps the most important finding is that color figures prominently into all levels of the network, and that performance on gray scale images is significantly diminished.  The new NF measure proposed here is sensible, but still based on the images shown to the network.  What one really wants to know is what function these nodes are computing - i.e., out of the space of *all* possible images, which most activate a unit?
